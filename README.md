## 🧠 What It Does

This project started as a real-time **Routing Optimization System** during the Champ Expo conducted in Vit,Chennai and later evolved into a comprehensive **Logistics Intelligence Platform** that:

- Suggests optimized routes using Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Minimizes operational costs using real-time data
- Automates warehouse management and truck dispatch
- Provides forecasting for inventory and sales
- Enables preventive truck maintenance
- Features a sleek, interactive UI to monitor all modules in real-time
